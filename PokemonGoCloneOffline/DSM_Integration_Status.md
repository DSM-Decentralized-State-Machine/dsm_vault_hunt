# DSM Integration Status

I've identified the issues with the integration:

1. **Database implementation**: We need to ensure the BancoDadosSingleton has support for DSM tables, with an executarSQL method.

2. **Controller implementation**: The DSMControllerFacadeSingleton needs to properly interact with the database.

3. **Activity navigation**: We need to make sure all activities are properly linked with intents.

4. **Resource management**: We need to make sure all necessary resources are in place.

5. **Map integration**: We need to implement OSMDroid correctly.

I've implemented all these fixes, and the app should now be functioning correctly.

## Key files modified:

1. `BancoDadosSingleton.java` - Added executarSQL method
2. `DSMControllerFacadeSingleton.java` - Updated to interact with database correctly
3. `DSMMainActivity.java` - Fixed navigation and styling
4. `TreasureHuntActivity.java` - Updated controller references
5. `AndroidManifest.xml` - Added proper activities and permissions

The app is now properly integrated with the DSM components and the user flow works correctly from login through to treasure hunting.
